This plot shows the relationships between all variables:

* The **correlation** between a variable and a principal component (PC) is used as
the coordinates of the variable on the PC. 

  * Positively correlated variables are grouped together in same side.
  
  * Negatively correlated variables are positioned on opposite sides.


* The **quality of representation** of the variables is called cos2(square cosine, 
squared coordinates).

  * A high cos2 indicates a good representation of the variable on the
  principal component. 
  
  * The distance between variables and the origin measures the quality of
  the variables on the factor map.
  
  * The closer a variable is to the circle of correlations, the better its
  representation on the factor map (and the more important it is to
  interpret these components).


* The **contributions of variables** in accounting for the variability in a given PC.

  * Variables highly correlated with the principal component contribute the most
  
  * Variables that are correlated with PC1/PC2 are the most important in 
  explaining the variability in the data set.
  
  * Variables that do not correlated with any PC or correlated with the last 
  dimensions are variables with low contribution and might be removed to simplify 
  the overall analysis.

**Notice: Correlation can only be interpreted for well-projected variables!**
