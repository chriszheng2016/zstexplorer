This plot shows the similarity between all individuals:

* The **projections** of a individual to a principal component (PC) is used as
the coordinates of the individual on the PC.

  * Similar individuals are grouped together in same side.
  
  * Dissimilar individuals are positioned on opposite sides.

* The **quality of representation** of the individuals is called cos2(
  square cosine, squared coordinates).

  * A high cos2 indicates a good representation of the individual on the
  principal component. 


* The **contributions of individuals** in accounting for the variability in a 
  given PC:

  * Individuals with a large coordinate value contribute most to the PC
  
  * Individuals with a larger coordinate value on PC1/PC2 contribute most in
    explaining the variability in the data set.
  
  * Individuals with a small coordinate value on PC1/PC2 or large coordinate in
    last dimensions contribute less.


**Notice: Similarity can only be interpreted for well-projected individuals!**
