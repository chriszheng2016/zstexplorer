**The Hopkins statistic** is used to assess the clustering tendency of a data set by measuring the probability that a given data set is generated by a uniform data distribution. In other words, it tests the spatial randomness of the data.

The null and the alternative hypotheses are defined as follow:

* Null hypothesis: the data set D is uniformly distributed (i.e., no meaningful clusters)

* Alternative hypothesis: the data set D is not uniformly distributed (i.e., contains meaningful clusters)

**Rule to judge:**

* If the value of Hopkins statistic is close to 1 (far above 0.5), the dataset is significantly clusterable. 
* If the value of Hopkins statistic is close to 0.5, the dataset is uniformly distributed.
